**QueueMate** – Your smart companion for waiting in line

**Project Description:**
QueueMate is a web application designed to enhance the customer experience at busy restaurants and cafés by providing a smart and efficient way to manage waiting times. Through the platform, customers can join waitlists online, monitor their position in real time, and receive notifications when their turn is approaching, eliminating the frustration of long queues. Meanwhile, venues benefit from a live dashboard that allows staff to manage tables, update wait times, and oversee the queue effortlessly. By combining real-time updates, live queue management, and timely notifications, QueueMate ensures a smooth and seamless experience for both customers and businesses.
